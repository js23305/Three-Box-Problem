        There are three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the other two doors, goats. 
        You pick a door, then the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.
        You are then given the option: stick with your original pick or swich to the upopened door.
        What should you do?
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>You choose one of three doors(1/3 chance of picking the car).</li>
        <li>The host, knowing where the car is, opens a door with a goat</li>
